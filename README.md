# teye

This project is a small (toy) UI framework that I originally intended to
develop for the Raspberry PI. It is based on modern OpenGL (ES) with shaders
and aims to be useful for tiny user interfaces. Nevertheless, my main interest
in this project is to improve my OpenGL skills.

The project's name *teye* is short for *tiny user interface* and intended to
pronounce like *tie* (the thing that you wear around your neck).
